    <p><b>Hello!</b><br/> My name is Avital Merchavi. <b>I am a QA Engineer with MA in Information Science and knowledge in User Experience </b>-(including courses in UX, customers behavior) of Bar - Ilan University.</br/>I have graduated with honors   
	 enjoyed studying there.<br/><b>I know and like the world of testing, theoretical and practical including writing STP, STD, STR.</b><br/><b>My skills are: creative,
	 very curious, ability to discren in small details, a high motiivation and excellent communication skills.</b><br/>The reason I have came to QA is because of my curiosness and my desire to test things.
	</p>  
	  <h2 style="color:orange;"> My moto is: Setting goals and working hard brings success.</h2>
	 <p>I would like to share a story that I had when I was in the end of 6th grade. I was sick and my English teacher taught the class Present Simple.<br/>When I came back to school, I didn't know that I didn't understand the material in English.
	 During the 7th grade I had low grades in English in the proficiency level group. The summer holiday arrived and I had been studing English myself for the whole summer holiday, including material of 10th grade! 
	 When I arrived to the 8th grade after that summer holiday my English teacher told me that I would removed to the intermediate level.
     She told me that next to other students. I was shocked and I said to myself that I would show her - I would come back soon to the proficiency level.
	</p>
	<p>Fortunately, the intermediate level teacher was nice to me. One lesson, she was teaching the Passive tense and wrote a sentence on the board in order to show the class how to turn it into Passive.
	 I raised my hand and said that sentence in Passive. All the students and the teacher were shocked and asked me how did I knew it. After a while my English teacher told me that I had to move to the proficiency group. I was so happy. 
	</p>
	<p>I was in the proficiency level again. I felt so proud of myself, I did it!
	 On my first examination my grade was 94 and that teacher wrote next my grade that I had improved very well!
	</p>
    <p>In the end of 9th grade we were tested for English groups to 10th grade. Based on my score, I was placed in the proficiency level group. I had been studing English myself the whole summer holiday again.
	 I arrived to 10th and during the English lessons I feld something strange. Suddenly, I found the English lessons easy. I asked my friends if they felt 
	 that too and they said no. I was bored in that group. 
	 After a while we were tested in our first examination and I got a high grade so my teacher told me that I had to move to the English speakers group. 
	 The next lesson I came to the same group and when my English teacher saw me she said again that I had to move to the English speakers group.I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. 
	 A story that has accompanied me throughout my life and demonstrates that <b>setting goals and working hard brings you success.</b>
